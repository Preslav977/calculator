# Calculator
In this project will do simple calculator.
The calculator can perform adding, subtraction, divide, multiplying.
The most important concepts in this calculator project was, how to make the storing display values into the display of calculator,
then to save the first number when the user inputs a first operand, then the operator which operation has been saved, and the second operand.
I had to use global variables since local can be accessed only in function score.
After then saving of those variables next hard thing was chaining those operators so the user can do 5 + 5 + 10 without using = operator,
next was doing 5 + 5 = 10, with using as equal operator.
